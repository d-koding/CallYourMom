# CallYourMom
5c hackathon project by Adrian Clement, Anjali Nuggehalli, Dylan O'Connor, and Natalie Roston

**Project Description**
Which Project Track you approached (only one)
Call Your Mom (CYM)  is on the Maker track. Our app has implications for 5C/college students and even a global audience. 
Which Overlays apply to your project (can be any number)
Best 5C/ Best Healthcare
How does your project relate to our theme of Tech for Good?
CYM contributes to the mission of Tech For Good because it incorporates some of the most innovative/complex technologies to solve an pertinent issue. Our solution can directly improve the health/ safety of people engaging in alcohol. 
What programming languages, tools, or other mediums did you use and how?
We used Python to write our Linear Regression model and back end. To make the back end, we used Flask & Sequel. We used React for our front end as well as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
What are the ethics of your project? Why is your project intentionally ethical? How have you worked to prevent harm within your project?
We work to discourage alcohol abuse and also recognize that assistance is sometimes needed beyond legal measures. Users can utilize our app to ensure they return home safely. By creating a hotline to a user’s trusted contacts, we provide inebriated users a guaranteed way to get help. 

**Purpose**
The purpose of CYM is to ensure safety while partying. Oftentimes, people drink past their body’s limits, and have no sense of accountability. CYM informs users of their tolerance while also providing safety and health reminders. Users can know their limits and have resources available if they need external help. 

**How It Works**
Our drink tolerance calculator determines the max drink allowance for the user using demographics info. Then, the user inputs their “Family” contacts which are their emergency contacts. Users are able to increment a counter each time they drink. When they near their limit, the app will tell them to pace themselves. There is a button that will take them straight to their emergency contacts (and 911) and a button using Uber API to call a rideshare directly to their current location. When the user is not on their phone, the app will push notifications that remind the user to drink water/other safety tips.
